No, really. I'm not here to tell you what to do. All I can do is share my thoughts and my humble experience.

## About me in 3 points

 * Second: I love going deep. I love to understand. To find. Outthinker.

 * Last: I'm a wildcard: S/W Design & Architecture, S/W Dev Hands-On, Leadership, Production, Public Speaking, Tutoring, Teaching, Game-Design, Live Role-Play Games, and more.

## Bio gist
* I'm coding since the late 80s.
